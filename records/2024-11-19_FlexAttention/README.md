## 11/19/24 FlexAttention record

This training has significant variance of around 0.005 stddev between runs. So not all runs go beneath 3.28, though [the mean is around 3.279](https://x.com/YouJiacheng/status/1859876224639828068).

This variance is probably caused by the previous record doubling the learning rate, plus this record significantly shortening the duration.
